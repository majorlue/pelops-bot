# Pelops says hello!

Heya, this is the repo for the discord bot Pelops. The purpose of this project is to provide a helper bot for Orna's Towers of Olympia. It's meant to provide easy access to Tower encounters, Tower floors, current Tower layout (fights, chests, puzzles) and potentially more. Slowly, but surely, features are being completed. Thanks for bearing with me =)

### Core Features:

✅ `/floors`: displays the current height for each Tower theme<br>
✅ `/encounter`: displays Tower fight information (floor guardians, strays)<br>
✅ `/submit`: allows **community contribution** for the current week's Tower layout<br>
✅ `/tower`: displays the specified theme's current layout, including floor guardians, stray monsters, puzzle types/difficulty and chests.<br>
✅ `/keys`: displays the current week's Tower floors with key fights<br>

### Discord

I don't have a dedicated Discord server for this bot, but instead we're hanging out over at [**Cade Labs** Discord](https://discord.gg/qsWtkwj6Yg)! (click)

Information about the bot, discussions, suggestions, bug reports etc. will be handled in a dedicated category over there. This should be more accessible as not everyone is familiar with GitHub.

### Bot Access

If you have admin permissions, you can add Pelops to your own server using **[this link (click)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1082499786067935232&permissions=414464658496&scope=applications.commands%20bot)**. If not, you can contact a server mod/admin about it. I can't add the bot to individual servers, so don't contact me about it.
