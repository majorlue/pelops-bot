# Pelops says hello!

Heya, this is the repo for the discord bot Pelops. The purpose of this project is to provide a helper bot for Orna's Towers of Olympia. It's meant to provide easy access to Tower encounters, Tower floors, current Tower layout (fights, chests, puzzles) and potentially more. Slowly, but surely, features are being completed. Thanks for bearing with me =)

### Core Features (wip):

✅ `/floors`: displays the current height for each Tower theme<br>
✅ `/encounter`: displays Tower fight information (floor guardians, strays)<br>
✅ `/submit`: allows **community contribution** for the current week's Tower layout<br>
✅ `/tower`: displays the specified theme's current layout, including floor guardians, stray monsters, puzzle types/difficulty and chests.<br>
✅ `/keys`: displays the current week's Tower floors with key fights<br>

### GitHub Issues

I'll be using GitHub Issues for bugs/requests/suggestions. All communication, orgnisation and progress reports will be over there. You can access **[GitHub Issues here](https://github.com/majorlue/pelops-bot/issues/new/choose)** (click).

###### Feature Requests

Feel free to make feature requests for the bot! Do keep in mind the scope of the bot, though. Currently it's just for Towers, so mostly anything related is fine.

###### Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug then please do report it. I'll do my best to fix issues as they crop up.

### Bot Access

As the project is new, the bot isn't in very many servers. If you have admin permissions, you can add Pelops to your own server using **[this link (click)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1082499786067935232&permissions=414464658496&scope=applications.commands%20bot)**. If not, you can contact a server mod/admin about it. I can't add the bot to individual servers, so don't contact me about it.
